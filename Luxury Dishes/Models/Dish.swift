    static let kobeDetails = """
Kobe is a special type of beef that comes from Wagyu cattle. To qualify as Kobe, the cattle must be born, raised, and processed within Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture in western Japan. The cattle are fed a diet rich in grains which adds to their higher fat content and tender texture. The resulting meat must have both a high marbling rating and meat quality rating to get the Kobe designation.

These standards are so strict that only 3,000 to 4,000 head of Kobe cattle come to market each year!

In the United States, Kobe beef can cost $25 to $50 per ounce—and more at restaurants. At COTE Miami, for example, a single ounce of Kobe beef will cost $76. With a protein this pricey, its preparation is best left to trained culinary professionals!

    static let whiteTrufflesDetails = """
White truffles, also known as Alba truffles, are one of the most expensive types of truffles in the world. Truffles are the edible spores of a type of underground fungus. The white variety has a strong, earthy flavor with notes of oak and garlic. They are often shaved on top of a finished dish like pasta, risotto, or eggs.

White truffles are primarily found in the Piedmont region of Italy, as well as in parts of Croatia and Slovenia. But why are they expensive? Because of how they grow. The truffle fungi require a special relationship with tree roots in order to grow. The fungi help the trees to gather water and minerals, and the tree feeds the truffle with sugars. Truffles also rely on forest creatures to eat them and spread their spores for propagation. This special codependent relationship is very hard to recreate in the wild, making truffles mostly foraged rather than cultivated.

This is why they’re so rare—and therefore, so expensive. A single ounce of white truffles could go for

Caviar is a luxury food that is made from the roe, or eggs, of sturgeon fish. Caviar is usually served as an appetizer, typically on toast points or blinis, and is often accompanied by sour cream, chives, and lemon.

The most expensive type of caviar is beluga caviar, which comes from the beluga sturgeon. This large fish often weighs nearly 600 lbs, but the largest ever recorded weighed in at 3,463 lbs!

The popularity of beluga caviar is an unfortunate development for sturgeon populations. The species has been wildly overfished, leading to its listing as a critically endangered species. This has caused caviar prices to soar. And in the United States, beluga caviar imports are banned due to the threat of beluga extinction.

But if you’re cuckoo for caviar, you can get U.S.-raised beluga caviar from Sturgeon AquaFarms in northern Florida. It will run you $830 for 28 grams (around an ounce) from their retail market.

    static let matsutakeMushroomsDetails = """
Matsutake mushrooms are highly prized in Japanese cuisine and are one of the most expensive types of mushrooms in the world. They have a strong, earthy aroma and a firm, meaty texture. They are harvested in the fall and can be eaten raw or cooked in a variety of dishes, such as soups, stews, and rice dishes.

These large mushrooms are native to Japan, but can also be found in parts of China, Korea, and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Like truffles, they cannot be reliably grown. Instead, they are foraged from among the roots of red pine trees.

Unfortunately, a type of roundworm has been damaging the pine trees that the mushrooms need to grow. As a result, the harvests of these mushrooms have dropped precipitously over the past seven decades—which has led the price to skyrocket. These special mushrooms can cost as much as $1,000 per pound!

A mushroom this rare should be the focus of the dish. In Escoffier’s plant-based culinary arts programs, students can explore how to make vegetables, fruits, and grains the star of the show.*

    static let kopiLuwakCoffeeDetails = """
Kopi luwak coffee has a highly unusual origin. It’s made from coffee beans that have been eaten and excreted by Asian palm civets, a type of wild cat-like animal native to Indonesia. Inside the civet’s digestive tract, the beans are fermented and partially broken down. The coffee is then harvested from the feces of the civet, washed thoroughly, and roasted. The coffee is said to have a rich, smooth flavor with hints of chocolate and caramel.

Kopi luwak coffee is one of the most expensive coffees in the world due to the labor-intensive process of collecting the beans and their limited supply. A pound of these beans—when harvested in the wild—can go for $600. And a cup could run you $100, making it the most expensive in the world.

There are concerns about this popular coffee having a detrimental effect on the civet population. Some people capture civets and keep them in poor conditions to mass-produce the beans. As naturally solitary animals, civets don’t thrive on farms. So make sure to only get yours from ethical sources!

    static let ibericoHamDetails = """
Iberico ham, also known as Jamón Ibérico, is a cured ham that is produced in Spain and Portugal. It has a complex, nutty flavor with hints of acorns, herbs, and spices. It’s served in thin slices and eaten on its own, so the flavor can shine through.

This meat is made from the Iberian pig, a breed that is known for its unique flavor and texture. These pigs are allowed to roam freely, where they get plump on an acorn-heavy diet. After processing, the meat is salted, dried, and aged for up to three years.

Due to the time involved in making it, Iberico ham can be quite pricey. A single leg (13 to 17 lbs) can cost between $500 and $4,500.
